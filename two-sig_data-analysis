### Read in training data set
train = pd.DataFrame(pd.read_json("Two-Sigma_Rental-Listings/train.json"))
test = pd.read_json("Two-Sigma_Rental-Listings/test.json")

### Data summary
train.info()
train.describe()


### Class distribution for variable of interest. Significant class imbalance for high interest group. 
train.interest_level.value_counts() / train.interest_level.count()
# low = 0.695
# medium = 0.228
# high = 0.0778


### People will likely be more interested in listings that offer a good deal.
price_pivot = pd.pivot_table(train, index=['bedrooms'], 
                values=['price'], aggfunc=[np.mean])
price_pivot.columns = ['meanprice']

beds_value = []
for i in range(0, len(train)):
        # beds = train.bedrooms[i]
        # beds_value = train.price[i] - price_pivot[beds]
